# Persian meter analysis

This is an ongoing experiment, in Rust, to detect the meter of a classical
Persian poem. The program command requires one argument, a filename; and that
file in turn must contain at least ten hemistichs of poetry (_i.e._, five
*bayt*s), with one hemistich per line. A sample file, `hafez-44.txt`, is
provided here. Results are printed to the terminal.
